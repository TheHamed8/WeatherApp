# WeatherApp
hi this is my weather app that i created with openWeatherMap api. i used Retrofit, Room, Coroutines, Hilt, Compose and other tools in it. i hope you like it 
if you are in IRAN you better use a V.P.N because the api isn't available in our country
and you better run the app in your light theme :)
